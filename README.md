# Multiplatform example

This project is an example for creating multiplatform (Figma/Sketch) plugin with React.

#### Prerequisites
- node
- Sketch
- Figma Desktop app

## Installation

```
make install
```

### 1. Start the web part

Then open a terminal and start the web part

```
cd web && npm run start
```

Now you can see your web part in `localhost:3000`.

### 2. Start the Sketch part

Open another terminal and build the sketch native part.

```
make build-sketch
```

Normally, Sketch should open and ask you to install the plugin.

### 3. Start the Figma part

Launch ngrok to expose the port 3000 to a https url.
```
./ngrok http 3000
```

Copy/paste the https ngrok tunnel url into the `figma/webpack.config.js`
```
const localUrl = '<insert your ngrok url here>';
```

Finally, open another terminal and start the figma webpack server

```
cd figma && npm run start
```

Now you can go in Figma Desktop app and click on `Manage plugins...` > `Create new plugin` > `Link existing plugin` and select the path to `figma/manifest.json`

You can use your plugin in Figma Desktop app üéâ

## Deployment

To deploy the plugin you need to deploy the three parts : 

### Deploy the web part

First deploy the React app, to do so, you have to build the app in production mode :

```
cd web && npm run build
```

Then to host the build folder on a server (AWS S3, Google Cloud storage, etc ...)

### Deploy the sketch part

First you need to build the plugin with the React app endpoint 

```
PLUGIN_ENDPOINT=https://my-endpoint.com && cd sketch && npm run build
```

Then zip the result 
```
tar -czvf <your-plugin-name>.tar.gz <your-plugin-name>.sketchplugin
```

Then you can give to your user this zip file to install you plugin. 

### Deploy the figma part

First you need to build the plugin with the React app endpoint

```
PLUGIN_ENDPOINT=https://my-endpoint.com && cd figma && npm run build
```

Then you can go in Figma Desktop app and click on `Manage plugins...` > `Create new plugin` > `Link existing plugin` and select the path to `figma/manifest.json`. 

Finally, you can publish the plugin on the figma community `Manage plugins...` > `<your plugin name>` > `publish` `
